
### One-to-Many (1:N)
1. **Category to Events**:
   - A single category (`catId`) can be associated with multiple events (`eventId`), but each event is associated with only one category.

2. **Events to Bookings**:
   - A single event (`eventId`) can have multiple bookings (`bookingId`), but each booking is associated with only one event.

3. **Registration to Bookings**:
   - A single user (`userId`) can make multiple bookings (`bookingId`), but each booking is associated with only one user.

4. **Registration to Events** (for event creation):
   - A single user (`userId`) can create multiple events (`eventId`), but each event is associated with only one user.

5. **Role to Registration**:
   - A single role (`roleId`) can be associated with multiple users (`userId`), but each user has only one role.

6. **Registration to AttendeesPayment**:
   - A single user (`userId`) can make multiple payments (`transactionId`), but each payment is associated with only one user.

### Many-to-One (N:1)
These are essentially the inverse of the one-to-many relationships mentioned above.

1. **Events to Category**:
   - Each event (`eventId`) is associated with one category (`catId`).

2. **Bookings to Events**:
   - Each booking (`bookingId`) is associated with one event (`eventId`).

3. **Bookings to Registration**:
   - Each booking (`bookingId`) is associated with one user (`userId`).

4. **Events to Registration** (for event creation):
   - Each event (`eventId`) is associated with one user (`userId`).

5. **Registration to Role**:
   - Each user (`userId`) is associated with one role (`roleId`).

6. **AttendeesPayment to Registration**:
   - Each payment (`transactionId`) is associated with one user (`userId`).

### Many-to-Many (M:N)
1. **Registration to Events** (for attending events):
   - This relationship is implied through the **Bookings** entity. A user can book multiple events, and an event can have multiple users booking it.

2. **Events to Registration** (for organizers and attendees):
   - Multiple users can organize or attend multiple events.
